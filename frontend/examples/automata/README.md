# Anypixel-App-Gridguys
by Nick Fox-Gieg

A simple cellular-automata experiment--check out the pattern options in the fillBoxSetup() function and try creating your own. Made with the Anypixel Framework by Google Creative Lab. 

To build it:
```sh
npm install
```
or 
```sh
npm run build
```

To run it, you'll need to install the [previewer app](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/anypixel/tree/master/frontend/previewer) first. Then in the app's root directory, do:
```sh   
preview
```
